# Payment Agent Evolution: From Simple Payments to Local Marketplace Platform

## Executive Summary

This document chronicles the complete evolution of the **Payment Agent** application from a basic payment processing tool to a comprehensive **Local Marketplace Platform**. Through iterative discussions and development, the app transformed into a dual-dimension marketplace connecting local sellers, event organizers, and buyers through proximity-based discovery.

---

## Original Vision (Starting Point)

### Initial Concept
The app began as a **Payment Agent** - a straightforward React Native application focused on:
- Basic payment processing using Stripe
- Payment method management
- Simple subscription handling
- User authentication and profiles

### Technical Foundation
- **Frontend:** React Native with Expo SDK 49
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- **Payments:** Stripe standard integration
- **Architecture:** Simple client-server with basic CRUD operations

---

## Evolution Timeline

### Phase 1: Stripe Connect Introduction
**Catalyst:** Need for marketplace functionality beyond simple payments

#### Key Discussions & Decisions:

- `pg_stripe-connect-onboarding` - Backend API functions

---

### Phase 2: Subscription Model Refinement
**Catalyst:** Need for flexible access models for different user types

#### Key Discussions & Decisions:
- **Problem:** One-size-fits-all subscriptions didn't match user needs
- **Insight:** Some users need temporary access, others need ongoing merchant capabilities
- **Solution:** Dual subscription model

#### Subscription Types Implemented:
1. **Daily Access**
   - One-time payment for 24-hour merchant access
   - Non-cancellable (consumable purchase)
   - Automatic expiry after 24 hours
   - Perfect for occasional sellers

2. **Recurring Subscriptions**
   - Monthly/yearly recurring billing
   - Cancellable with proper subscription management
   - For regular merchants and event organizers

#### Technical Implementation:
- Updated `SubscriptionContext.tsx` with dual payment flows
- Added expiry logic and background status checking
- Clear UI distinction between payment types
- Integrated with Stripe Connect onboarding requirements

---

### Phase 3: Events as First-Class Content
**Catalyst:** Recognition that local commerce is event-driven

#### Key Discussions & Decisions:
- **Initial Assumption:** Events would be secondary to products
- **Breakthrough Insight:** Events (garage sales, farmers markets, auctions) are primary drivers of local commerce
- **Paradigm Shift:** Treat events as equal to products in marketplace hierarchy

#### Event Types Identified:
- **Sales Events:** Garage sales, estate sales, auctions
- **Markets:** Farmers markets, flea markets, craft fairs
- **Mobile Commerce:** Food trucks, pop-up shops
- **Community Events:** Country fairs, neighborhood sales

#### Architecture Impact:
- Events became a parallel dimension to products
- Required specialized discovery interfaces
- Needed calendar-based browsing (not just lists)
- Different data models and user interactions

#### Database Schema:
```sql
-- Events table with geolocation and temporal data
CREATE TABLE pg_events (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    organizer_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(50) CHECK (event_type IN (...)),
    start_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    end_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    latitude DECIMAL(10, 8),
    longitude DECIMAL(11, 8),
    contact_info JSONB,
    -- ... additional fields
);
```

---

### Phase 4: Geolocation-Centric Design
**Catalyst:** Understanding that proximity is the key differentiator for local marketplaces

#### Key Discussions & Decisions:
- **Core Insight:** Local commerce is fundamentally about proximity
- **Design Principle:** Every product and event must be geotagged
- **Technical Requirement:** Spatial queries for distance-based discovery

#### Geolocation Features:
- **Automatic Geotagging:** GPS coordinates captured during creation
- **Spatial Indexing:** PostGIS integration for efficient proximity queries
- **Distance Calculations:** Real-time distance sorting and filtering
- **Map Interfaces:** Visual browsing of nearby items and events

#### Technical Implementation:
```sql
-- PostGIS spatial indexing
CREATE INDEX idx_pg_events_location ON pg_events USING GIST (
    ST_Point(longitude, latitude)
);

-- Proximity queries
SELECT * FROM pg_events 
WHERE ST_DWithin(
    ST_Point(longitude, latitude),
    ST_Point($user_lng, $user_lat),
    10000  -- 10km radius
);
```

#### Location Services:
- `LocationContext.tsx` - Real-time GPS tracking
- Automatic coordinate capture in creation forms
- Permission handling and error states
- Background location updates

---

### Phase 5: Specialized Discovery Interfaces
**Catalyst:** Recognition that different content types need different discovery patterns

#### Key Discussions & Decisions:
- **Products:** Traditional e-commerce browsing patterns work well
- **Events:** Calendar-based discovery is more intuitive
- **Insight:** Users think about events temporally, products categorically

#### Discovery Patterns Implemented:

##### For Products:
- **List View:** Traditional scrollable product grid
- **Map View:** Geographic clustering and browsing
- **Filtering:** By category, price, condition, distance

##### For Events:
- **Calendar View:** Primary interface showing events by date
- **List View:** Alternative chronological browsing
- **Map View:** Geographic event discovery
- **Filtering:** By event type, date range, distance

#### UI Components:
- `react-native-calendars` integration for event discovery
- Segmented controls for view mode switching
- Event type chips with color coding
- Distance-based sorting indicators

## Stripe Connect Onboarding Flow

### Overview
The marketplace uses Stripe Connect to enable sellers to receive payments directly while the platform collects fees. This creates a compliant, secure payment infrastructure where sellers become "Connected Accounts" under the platform's main Stripe account.

### How Stripe Connect Onboarding Works

#### 1. Account Creation (Backend)
When a user wants to become a seller:
- Frontend calls `createConnectAccount()` from `StripeConnectContext`
- Backend function `pg_stripe-connect-onboarding` creates a Stripe Connect account
- Stripe returns an account ID (e.g., `acct_1234567890`)
- Account details stored in `pg_stripe_connect_accounts` table

```typescript
// Backend creates Connect account
const account = await stripe.accounts.create({
  type: 'express', // Simplified onboarding
  country: 'US',
  email: user.email,
});
```

#### 2. Onboarding Link Generation (Backend)
- Backend generates a secure, time-limited onboarding URL
- Link hosted entirely by Stripe (not your servers)
- Expires after 24 hours for security
- Contains return/refresh URLs for deep linking back to app

```typescript
const accountLink = await stripe.accountLinks.create({
  account: account.id,
  return_url: 'paymentagent://merchant/onboarding/complete',
  refresh_url: 'paymentagent://merchant/onboarding/refresh',
  type: 'account_onboarding',
});
```

#### 3. User Completes Onboarding (Stripe's Website)
User is redirected to Stripe's secure hosted form where they provide:

**Business Information:**
- Business name and type
- Business address
- Industry/product description
- Website (if applicable)

**Personal Information (for identity verification):**
- Full legal name
- Date of birth
- Social Security Number (SSN) or Tax ID
- Personal address
- Phone number

**Banking Information:**
- Bank routing number
- Bank account number
- Account type (checking/savings)

**Document Uploads (if required):**
- Government-issued ID
- Business documents (articles of incorporation, etc.)
- Additional verification documents as needed

#### 4. Redirect Back to App
- After completion, Stripe redirects using deep link URLs
- App receives the redirect and calls `refreshAccountStatus()`
- Backend queries Stripe API for updated account capabilities
- Database updated with new onboarding status

### Test Data for Development

When testing the onboarding flow, use Stripe's test data:

**Personal Information:**
- SSN: `000-00-0000`
- Phone: Any US phone number format
- Address: Any valid US address

**Banking Information:**
- Routing Number: `110000000`
- Account Number: `000123456789`
- Account Type: Checking

**Business Information:**
- Use any realistic business name and address
- Industry: Select appropriate category
- Website: Can be left blank or use placeholder

### Account Status Flow

```
pending → in_progress → completed → active
    ↓         ↓           ↓         ↓
 Created   Started    Submitted  Verified
```

**Status Definitions:**
- `pending`: Account created, onboarding not started
- `in_progress`: User has started but not completed onboarding
- `completed`: All information submitted, under review
- `active`: Fully verified, can accept payments
- `restricted`: Issues found, additional information needed

### Payment Capabilities

Once onboarding is complete, the Connect account gains capabilities:
- `charges_enabled`: Can receive payments
- `payouts_enabled`: Can receive payouts to bank account
- `transfers_enabled`: Can receive transfers from platform

### Integration Points

**Frontend Context (`StripeConnectContext`):**
- `createConnectAccount()`: Initiates account creation
- `getOnboardingUrl()`: Gets fresh onboarding link
- `refreshAccountStatus()`: Updates account status
- `isOnboardingComplete`: Boolean for UI state
- `canAcceptPayments`: Boolean for payment capabilities

**Backend API (`pg_stripe-connect-onboarding`):**
- `create_connect_account`: Creates Stripe account
- `create_onboarding_link`: Generates onboarding URL
- `get_account_status`: Fetches current account state
- `refresh_onboarding_link`: Creates new URL if expired

**Database Schema (`pg_stripe_connect_accounts`):**
```sql
- stripe_account_id: Stripe's account identifier
- onboarding_status: Current onboarding state
- charges_enabled: Can receive payments
- payouts_enabled: Can receive payouts
- requirements: Array of missing information
```

### Security Considerations

**Data Protection:**
- No sensitive financial data stored in your database
- All PII handled by Stripe's PCI-compliant infrastructure
- Account tokens and secrets managed by Stripe

**Compliance:**
- Stripe handles KYC (Know Your Customer) verification
- AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance automated
- Tax reporting (1099-K) handled by Stripe

**Access Control:**
- Only account owners can view their Connect account details
- Platform can only access account status and capabilities
- Sensitive account details remain with Stripe

### Error Handling

**Common Issues:**
- Expired onboarding links (generate new one)
- Incomplete information (redirect to complete)
- Account restrictions (provide additional documents)
- Bank account verification failures (re-verify)

**Recovery Flows:**
- Refresh expired links automatically
- Provide clear error messages for missing information
- Guide users through document upload process
- Support contact for complex verification issues

### Production Considerations

**Before Going Live:**
- Switch to live Stripe API keys
- Configure webhook endpoints for real-time updates
- Set up monitoring for failed onboardings
- Prepare customer support for verification issues
- Test with real bank accounts (small amounts)

**Ongoing Maintenance:**
- Monitor account status changes via webhooks
- Handle account restrictions promptly
- Keep onboarding links fresh (regenerate before expiry)
- Provide clear communication about verification timelines

This Stripe Connect integration provides a seamless, compliant way for users to become sellers while maintaining platform control over the payment flow and fee collection.

## Key Innovation: Dual-Dimension Marketplace

### Breakthrough Insight
The critical realization was treating **products and events as equal marketplace dimensions** rather than events being secondary to products. This reflects how local commerce actually works:

- **Events drive discovery** - People find garage sales, then browse items
- **Events create foot traffic** - Farmers markets bring buyers together
- **Events are temporal** - Time-sensitive opportunities require calendar interfaces
- **Products are persistent** - Inventory can be browsed anytime

### Implementation Strategy
- **Parallel Data Models:** Events and products as first-class entities
- **Specialized UIs:** Calendar for events, lists/grids for products
- **Unified Geotagging:** Both content types support proximity discovery
- **Cross-Linking:** Events can feature specific products

## Subscription System Testing Guide

### Subscription Purchase Flow

The subscription system supports two types of merchant plans:
1. **Daily Access** - One-time payment for 24-hour merchant access
2. **Recurring Subscriptions** - Monthly/yearly recurring billing

#### Payment Completion Updates
When a subscription purchase is completed successfully:

**pg_user_subscriptions table:**
- New record inserted with:
  - `user_id` - The purchasing user's UUID
  - `plan_id` - The merchant plan UUID from pg_merchant_plans
  - `stripe_subscription_id` - For recurring plans
  - `stripe_payment_intent_id` - For one-time payments
  - `status` - Set to 'active' when payment succeeds
  - `type` - Either 'recurring' or 'one_time'
  - `expires_at` - For one-time payments (24 hours from purchase)
  - `current_period_start/end` - For recurring subscriptions

**pg_profiles table:**
- `current_plan_id` - Updated to the purchased plan's UUID
- `subscription_status` - Set to 'active'
- `merchant_status` - Changed to 'plan_purchased'
- `updated_at` - Timestamp of the update

### Duplicate Purchase Prevention

The system prevents users from purchasing multiple active subscriptions through:

#### 1. Application-Level Check (pg_subscription-checkout edge function)
```typescript
// Enhanced check with expiry validation
if (profile.subscription_status === 'active') {
  const { data: activeSubscriptions } = await supabaseClient
    .from('pg_user_subscriptions')
    .select('expires_at, status')
    .eq('user_id', profile.id)
    .eq('status', 'active');

  const hasValidSubscription = activeSubscriptions?.some(sub => 
    !sub.expires_at || new Date(sub.expires_at) > new Date()
  );

  if (hasValidSubscription) {
    throw new Error('User already has an active subscription')
  }
}
```

#### 2. Database-Level Constraint (Recommended)
```sql
-- Create partial unique index to prevent multiple active subscriptions
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_active_subscription_per_user 
ON pg_user_subscriptions (user_id) 
WHERE status = 'active';
```

### Manual Subscription Expiration (For Testing)

To reset a user's subscription status for testing multiple purchases:

#### Recommended Approach (Expire Subscription)
```sql
-- Expire the subscription (maintains audit trail)
UPDATE pg_user_subscriptions 
SET 
  status = 'expired',
  expires_at = NOW(),
  current_period_end = NOW(),
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_UUID_HERE' 
  AND status = 'active';

-- Reset profile status
UPDATE pg_profiles 
SET 
  subscription_status = 'none',
  merchant_status = 'none',
  current_plan_id = NULL,
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 'YOUR_USER_UUID_HERE';
```

#### Alternative Approach (Delete Records)
```sql
-- Delete subscription records (loses audit trail)
DELETE FROM pg_user_subscriptions 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_UUID_HERE' AND status = 'active';

-- Reset profile status
UPDATE pg_profiles 
SET 
  subscription_status = 'none',
  merchant_status = 'none', 
  current_plan_id = NULL,
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 'YOUR_USER_UUID_HERE';
```

**Note:** The expiration approach is recommended as it maintains historical data for analytics and debugging purposes.

### Testing Workflow

1. **Purchase Subscription** - Use the StorefrontScreen to select and purchase a plan
2. **Verify Prevention** - Attempt to purchase another subscription (should be blocked)
3. **Expire Subscription** - Run manual expiration SQL to reset user state
4. **Repeat Testing** - Purchase different plans to test various scenarios
