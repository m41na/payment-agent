## Cross-Feature Integration Architecture

### Integration Patterns
Each feature exposes a clean public API that other features can consume:

```typescript
// Example: Product Discovery using Location Services
import { useLocationServices } from '../location-services';
import { useSearch } from '../product-discovery';

const { findNearbyItems, currentLocation } = useLocationServices();
const { searchProducts } = useSearch();

// Location-aware product search
const nearbyProducts = findNearbyItems(searchProducts(query), currentLocation, 5, 'km');
```

### Data Flow Architecture
- **Event-driven**: Features communicate through events and callbacks
- **Loose Coupling**: Features depend on interfaces, not implementations
- **Shared State**: Common data managed through context providers
- **Real-time Sync**: Supabase real-time subscriptions keep data synchronized

### Common Patterns
1. **Service Layer**: Business logic encapsulated in singleton services
2. **React Hooks**: State management and UI integration through custom hooks
3. **Public APIs**: Clean interfaces for cross-feature integration
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent error patterns across all features
5. **Caching**: Intelligent caching strategies for performance optimization
